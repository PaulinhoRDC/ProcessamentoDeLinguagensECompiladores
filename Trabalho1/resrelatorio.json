Whether they had played with dolls or not their bodies physically and emotionally and instinctively are preparing for motherhood with the onset of periods the hormone levels increase and the brain and body responds. That is all a very natural experience. Females make choices through life and defer and mentally push aside those natural body rhythms if they aspire to do and achieve other things outside of motherhood.Men, if they are good at childcare, they have also mentally pushed aside their natural body rhythms to aspire to be a good father to their children and they can be as good but they have had to mentally and physically worked a lot harder to achieve the same outcome as a natural mother.Men can be as good at childcare as women, but women can be as good as men at other things.Accept that we are all human beings and when needs must humans can only survive by adapting to the situations we are all faced with at any given time.

What's he supposed to say. \"We women are as equal at business as men true so lets hand pregnancy over to men impossible; and we'll stand at urinals too so there?\" Doubtless, one day, someone will invent plug in men's genitalia for women so they can do that. We are two different genders. We have different hormones. What I have found is that  women want to be treated the same as men until it suits them to be treated as women.
